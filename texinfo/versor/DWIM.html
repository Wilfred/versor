<h3 class="section">4.4 Do What I Mean</h3>

<p>
Sometimes Versor deviates from its most logical design, to make sure
that the cursor ends up where you are likeliest to want it. 

An example of this is that if you are moving by s-expressions, and
move forward from the last one in the enclosing expression, the cursor
moves to the end of the last expression, and then on past any
whitespace and comments, ending up where you are likely to want to
type the next s-expression.

However, it is still not always possible to get to exactly the right
place without using character-level movements. For these
circumstances, Versor provides a &ldquo;Do What I Mean&rdquo; (DWIM) command,
which moves the cursor to a point likely to be of interest that is
otherwise hard to get at using the current Versor dimension. This
command is normally bound to the key <kbd>M-home</kbd>. Alternatively, it
can be accessed with <kbd>M-x versor:dwim</kbd>.

This function reads the user's mind, using the following algorithm:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>  Tell the user what has been done each time;
<li>  Eventually, the user will come to expect the behaviour of this
  function;
<li>  Reading what the user wants Versor to do should then usually be
  trivial.
        </ol>

Aspects of mental state not necessary for figuring out where to leave point are
factored out of the calculations.

<span class="command">versor:dwim</span> is mode-specific in its behaviour. For example,
in programming language modes, it can move point in and out of string
constants and comments.
