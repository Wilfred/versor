<h2 class="chapter">5 Refactoring using Languide</h2>

<p>
Some more sophisticated commands, replacing long sequences of manual
keyboard labour by the programmer, are provided by the companion
package, Languide. As described here, they are accessed through some
wrapper functions which apply them to the versor selection. You can
also access these directly to act on GNUemacs region;
See <a href="../languide/index.html#Top">Top (languide)</a>.

A typical action (probably the one the author uses most often) is
converting an expression to a local variable (so that the value can be
re-used), involving the following steps:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>examine the expression for the variables it needs
<li>find the nearest scoping point, or (with a prefix arg) the widest
scoping point at which all the variables needed are defined
<li>deduce the type of the expression (in statically typed languages
only)
<li>insert a declaration for a variable (with the name supplied by the
user) at the chosen scoping point, and initialize it using the
original expression
<li>replace the original expression with a use of the new variable
<li>leave the new variable at the top of the kill ring, ready to be
inserted somewhere else
<li>
        </ol>

Likewise, there is a function to turn a block of code into a function
(working out automatically what needs to be passed in as the argument
list), and replace its original occurrence with a call to the new
function.

To draw attention to what they have done, these functions highlight,
with a red background, any changes they make away from the cursor. The
highlighting is not the Versor selection, and is removed on your next
input to GNUemacs.

These commands are divided into two groups, one of them acting on
expressions (as used in both functional and imperative languages) and
one acting on statements, as used in imperative languages.
