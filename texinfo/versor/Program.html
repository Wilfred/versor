<h3 class="section">3.6 Program coordinates</h3>

<p>
Program coordinates uses the syntax of programming languages to guide
to the cursor movements. This uses the accompanying package, Languide
(see <a href="../languide/index.html#Top">Top (languide)</a>), to provide the primitives for moving around
source code. It is, of course, mode-specific.

Languide definitions are already reasonably comprehensive for Lisp, C,
Perl and Java, in progress for shell scripts, and planned for Haskell and
Python. They would probably not be meaningful for PostScript. You are
encouraged to contribute further or better definitions, both for the
languages already covered and for others.

The dimensions defined in program coordinates are as follows:

     <ul>
<li>chars
<li>exprs
<li>statement parts
<li>statements
<li>defuns
</ul>
   
Apart from the statement-related dimensions, these are the same as
those in structural coordinates See <a href="Structural.html#Structural">Structural</a>. 

Movement by statement parts moves the selection between parts of the
current statement.  Programming language statements can typically be
divided into two or three parts, as follows:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The head of a statement is often a condition, such as in an
<code>if</code> or a <code>while</code> statement.
<li>The body of a statement is typically another statement, or a group of
statements, such as the body of an <code>if</code> or a <code>while</code>
statement.
<li>The tail of a statement occurs in only a few statement types, such as
<code>if-then-else</code> or <code>try-catch-finally</code>. 
        </ol>

The &ldquo;statement parts&rdquo; dimension will move between these in turn, and can
also moved to the <dfn>container</dfn> of the current statement, that is, a
grouping statement surrounding it. 

when you select the body of a statement, and the body is a compound
statement, you can then either:

     <ul>
<li>continue moving to other parts of the same statement
<li>select statements within the body, by using the &ldquo;statements&rdquo;
dimension movements
</ul>
   

If using voice input (see <a href="Voice-input.html#Voice-input">Voice input</a>), it is convenient to define
commands such as &ldquo;head&rdquo;, &ldquo;body&rdquo;,and &ldquo;container&rdquo;, so that you can
jump directly to the one you want rather than treating it as part of a
sequence. The commands <span class="command">navigate-this-head</span>,
<span class="command">navigate-this-body</span>, <span class="command">navigate-this-tail</span>,
<span class="command">navigate-this-whole</span>, and <span class="command">navigate-this-container</span>
are available for binding directly to voice commands (or, for that
matter, to keys of their own).

The &ldquo;statement&rdquo; dimension moves between successive statements at the
same structural level. This is different from the statement movements
provided as part of the GNUemacs' C-mode, which moves in and out of
compound statements.
