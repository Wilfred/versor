Text editors have traditionally operated in terms of lines and
characters.

Languide takes a step out of that, providing operations in terms of
the syntactic units (statements, expressions) that make up source
files in typical programming languages.

It aims to provide as single commands many of the routine high-level
editing actions that normally take many manual editing operations, for
example, taking a block of code and turning it into a function,
leaving a call to that function where the code originally was.
Although complex, these actions are completely stereotyped, and
therefore ripe for automation, as they do not really require human
intelligence to perform them. It is hoped that automating them will
not only reduce the workload for the user's fingers, but may also be
more reliable, and provide a more productive and relaxing working
environment.

In an attempt to break the tie with keyboard and mouse, on the whole
the commands are designed to work well with voice input. It should be
possible to work with very little need to type or pronounce syntactic
punctuation characters; these are detail that the computer should be
able to deal with, leaving the programmer to get on with the abstract
thinking. The need to issue a sequence of commands with no punctuation
leads naturally to an RPN-style semantics (which should be already
comfortable to users of HP-style calculators, Forth, and PostScript).
There is, for example, provision for selecting a statement type and
then searching for it, or inserting a template for it.
