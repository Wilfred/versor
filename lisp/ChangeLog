	messages for the motion framework

	* languide.el (region-type-description): suppress output of
	unknown region types, even when other information is present

	* versor.el (versor-setup): output messages during setup, to
	confirm what was set up

	* versor-commands.el (versor-transpose): allow lists of items to
	be passed in by the motion framework; use this for versor-kill

2007-07-16  John C G Sturdy  <jcgs@hosea>

	* versor-status.el (versor-set-status-display): Tried to suppress
	the dimension messages on changing buffer.

	* versor-local.el (versor-buffer-change-function): there was an
	error in switching buffer; it was trying to use the dimension
	number as a dimension name

	function being run by a defined insertion

2007-07-02  John C G Sturdy  <jcgs@HOSEA>

	* versor-base-moves.el (next-texp): try sentence-end as a function
	if available (as in Emacs 23) and if not available, try as a
	variable as in older Emacsen.

	* versor-local.el (versor-buffer-change-function): Use the
	per-buffer values of meta-level and level only when they are
	valid.

	* versor-tlc.el (versor-tlc-display-all-diagram): Wrote function
	to display all versor-tlc keymaps, as popping them up one at a
	time isn't working well, at least on windows-emacs.
	(versor-tlc-do-map): Fix looking up next key read while displaying
	diagrams on the fly.
