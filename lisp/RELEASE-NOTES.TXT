Release notes for versor.el and friends.

0.0

Initial release, just to get something out there. The framework is
based on something I've been using for a long time, and I've had a
good go at untangling it from the rest of my emacs setup. I've also
started to move it forward -- the idea of always have an ``item''
cursor is quite new and not really complete (it should be possible to
have a discontiguous selection, but that's not really there yet).

The language-guided motion code that is needed to support
statement-based motion is currently in another of my directories. This
could do with a lot more work on it, and is where I'd most welcome
contributed code.
