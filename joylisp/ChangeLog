	* joylisp.c, joylisp.h: make Button_Name construct a name even
	when the joystick doesn't name its buttons.

2008-01-22  John Sturdy  <jcgs@ezekiel.csis.ul.ie>

	* joystick.el (joystick-gamepad-setup): We shouldn't be killing or
	yanking in Info buffers, so re-use the buttons

2008-01-17  John Sturdy  <jcgs@ezekiel.csis.ul.ie>

	* joylisp.c (main): Output error message as sexp if unable to find
	joystick.

2007-12-13  John Sturdy  <jcgs@hosea>

	* joystick.el (jse): Improved checking of whether a button has a
	binding: it now tries to follow the keymap tree.  This is
	necessary to allow buttons that are not bound as the first event
	of a sequence, to be read as a subsequent event in a sequence.

2007-12-12  John Sturdy  <jcgs@hosea>

	* joystick.el (jse): Make the joystick event into a list only when
	there are arguments to include.  This seems to be necessary to
	make joystick buttons work as command prefixes.  I don't yet know
	what it will break, but I vaguely remember having specific reason
	to make the events be lists (perhaps before I started this
	ChangeLog file).

2007-10-25  John Sturdy  <jcgs@hosea>

	* joylisp.c (main): Further work on multiple joysticks in one
	controller.

2007-10-17  John Sturdy  <jcgs@hosea>

	* joystick.el (joystick-gamepad-setup): in joystick buffer-list,
	and joystick dired, rebind the hat keys that would otherwise bring
	up the other of those two.  And while I'm at it, make them do
	something useful. too.

2007-10-16  John Sturdy  <jcgs@hosea>

	* joylisp.c (main): argument parser now uses getopt

	* joystick.el (joystick-label-modified): Improvements to label
	generation.

	* joylisp.c (draw_diagram): Improvements to label parsing.
	Centred the label text.

2007-10-14  John Sturdy  <jcgs@hosea>

	* joylisp.c (main): Improved on-the-fly labelling; used polygon
	fill for the main shape.

2007-10-12  John Sturdy  <jcgs@hosea>

	* joylisp.c (draw_diagram): basic X display
	(draw_diagram): added on-the-fly labelling from Emacs

	* joystick.el (joystick-gamepad-setup): moved window size control
	and speed control, added dired

2007-10-07  John Sturdy  <jcgs@hosea>

	* joylisp.c: use floating point for countdowns etc

2007-09-27  John Sturdy  <jcgs@hosea>

	* joylisp.c (main): add some output for beginning and end of
	initialization

	* joystick.el (joystick-gamepad-setup): tidy up some of the more
	systematic button-binding

2007-09-24  John Sturdy  <jcgs@hosea>

	* joystick.el (in-other-window): Added commands for moving point
	in other windows --- might as well use up the spare analog
	joystick.  And since the analog joysticks have a button in them,
	used that to work on the second other window.

2007-09-07  John Sturdy  <jcgs@hosea>

	* joylisp.c (main): Include joystick name when reporting back
	speed.

	* joystick.el (joystick-start): Allow multiple joysticks active at
	once.

2007-09-06  John Sturdy  <jcgs@hosea>

	* joystick.el (joystick-diagram-replace-label): Improve the
	joystick help system
