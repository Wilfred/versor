2010-12-30  John Sturdy  <john.sturdy@citrix.com>

	* joylisp_graphics.c (draw_diagram): fixes to labelling.

	* joylisp.c (command_source): Command to run commands from a file.

2010-12-28  John Sturdy  <jcgs@hosea>

	* joylisp.c (check_init_complete): Allocate controller-wide button
	alias array *after* counting how long it must be, instead
	of *before*.

2009-02-13  John C G Sturdy  <john.sturdy@ul.ie>

	* joylisp.c (main): use /dev/input/js0 instead of /dev/js0 as the
	default device.
	(js_do_axis_event): Suppress spurious output of 32767 and -32767.

	* joylisp.h, joylisp.c, joylisp_graphics.c: Use GPL v3.

	* joylisp.c (js_do_axis_event): Added calibration output.

2008-12-01  John Sturdy  <john.sturdy@ul.ie>

	* joystick.el (joystick-increase-threshold): Added threshold
	command to the elisp.

2008-09-28  John Sturdy  <john.sturdy@ul.ie>

	* joylisp.c (process_command): added commands "report" and
	"threshold", with a view to being able to suppress the small
	spurious movements that sometimes occur.
	(js_do_axis_event): Added thresholding.
	(process_command): Moved all the commands into their own
	functions, then made a list of command names and functions instead
	of a series of hard-coded strcmps; that also let me do a help
	function that lists all the command names automatically

2008-07-17  John Sturdy  <john.sturdy@ul.ie>

	* joystick.el (find-error-or-this-file-or-tag): finding things
	requires ffap

2008-04-30  John Sturdy  <john.sturdy@ul.ie>

	* joystick.el (joystick-gamepad-setup): make the "find" button
	understand filenames

2008-02-22  John Sturdy  <john.sturdy@ul.ie>

	* joylisp.c (check_init_complete): Set up countdown for
	initializing all sticks correctly.

2008-02-14  John Sturdy  <john.sturdy@ul.ie>

	* joylisp.h, joylisp.c (new_joystick): Filled in possibly sensible
	defaults in axmap, as it appears that some joysticks (or drivers)
	may not fill it in properly (bug reported by T.V. Raman.).

2008-02-04  John Sturdy  <john.sturdy@ul.ie>

	* joystick.el (jse): Accept chords from the controller process.

	* joylisp.h, joylisp.c (js_do_button_event): Output chords as well
	as modifiers-action groups.

2008-02-01  John Sturdy  <john.sturdy@ul.ie>

	* joystick.el (in-other-window): Comment out debugging message.

	* joylisp.c (get_joystick_config): Output a description of the
	unlabelled buttons, if we can't get the labelling.

2008-01-30 John Sturdy  <john.sturdy@ul.ie>
	* Move into emacs-versor as a new module, joylisp.  Release on
	sourceforge.

2008-01-30  John Sturdy  <jcgs@hosea>

	* joylisp.c, joylisp.h: make Button_Name construct a name even
	when the joystick doesn't name its buttons.

2008-01-22  John Sturdy  <jcgs@ezekiel.csis.ul.ie>

	* joystick.el (joystick-gamepad-setup): We shouldn't be killing or
	yanking in Info buffers, so re-use the buttons

2008-01-17  John Sturdy  <jcgs@ezekiel.csis.ul.ie>

	* joylisp.c (main): Output error message as sexp if unable to find
	joystick.

2007-12-13  John Sturdy  <jcgs@hosea>

	* joystick.el (jse): Improved checking of whether a button has a
	binding: it now tries to follow the keymap tree.  This is
	necessary to allow buttons that are not bound as the first event
	of a sequence, to be read as a subsequent event in a sequence.

2007-12-12  John Sturdy  <jcgs@hosea>

	* joystick.el (jse): Make the joystick event into a list only when
	there are arguments to include.  This seems to be necessary to
	make joystick buttons work as command prefixes.  I don't yet know
	what it will break, but I vaguely remember having specific reason
	to make the events be lists (perhaps before I started this
	ChangeLog file).

2007-10-25  John Sturdy  <jcgs@hosea>

	* joylisp.c (main): Further work on multiple joysticks in one
	controller.

2007-10-17  John Sturdy  <jcgs@hosea>

	* joystick.el (joystick-gamepad-setup): in joystick buffer-list,
	and joystick dired, rebind the hat keys that would otherwise bring
	up the other of those two.  And while I'm at it, make them do
	something useful. too.

2007-10-16  John Sturdy  <jcgs@hosea>

	* joylisp.c (main): argument parser now uses getopt

	* joystick.el (joystick-label-modified): Improvements to label
	generation.

	* joylisp.c (draw_diagram): Improvements to label parsing.
	Centred the label text.

2007-10-14  John Sturdy  <jcgs@hosea>

	* joylisp.c (main): Improved on-the-fly labelling; used polygon
	fill for the main shape.

2007-10-12  John Sturdy  <jcgs@hosea>

	* joylisp.c (draw_diagram): basic X display
	(draw_diagram): added on-the-fly labelling from Emacs

	* joystick.el (joystick-gamepad-setup): moved window size control
	and speed control, added dired

2007-10-07  John Sturdy  <jcgs@hosea>

	* joylisp.c: use floating point for countdowns etc

2007-09-27  John Sturdy  <jcgs@hosea>

	* joylisp.c (main): add some output for beginning and end of
	initialization

	* joystick.el (joystick-gamepad-setup): tidy up some of the more
	systematic button-binding

2007-09-24  John Sturdy  <jcgs@hosea>

	* joystick.el (in-other-window): Added commands for moving point
	in other windows --- might as well use up the spare analog
	joystick.  And since the analog joysticks have a button in them,
	used that to work on the second other window.

2007-09-07  John Sturdy  <jcgs@hosea>

	* joylisp.c (main): Include joystick name when reporting back
	speed.

	* joystick.el (joystick-start): Allow multiple joysticks active at
	once.

2007-09-06  John Sturdy  <jcgs@hosea>

	* joystick.el (joystick-diagram-replace-label): Improve the
	joystick help system
