;;; Commentary:

;; This listens (and occasionally talks) to a companion process which
;; is implemented by joylisp.c.

;; It makes the joystick events appear like extra function keys.  A
;; basic set of bindings is included (search this file for "Bindings") .

;; A help function attempts to draw a typical gamepad and label it
;; with the bindings.  On a typical gamepad, this might be the button
;; labelled "10" or "BaseBtn4".

;; More detail:

;; The companion process can be started and stopped by
;; `joystick-start' and `joystick-stop'.  `joystick-start' has the
;; rudiments of multiple joystick support (it lets you select the
;; device, and give it a prefix for the stuff it sends back to Emacs)
;; but doesn't as yet follow through on that -- for example, there is
;; just a plain variable for the joystick process.  But I do intend to
;; do that sometime, unless someone else does it first.

;; The joystick communication process sends s-exps to Emacs, which
;; `eval's them in a process filter.  Mostly, they run a function
;; `jse' (standing for JoyStick Event), which sticks its argument (the
;; event) into the unprocessed event queue.  This makes them look a
;; bit like function keys, and fortunately Emacs isn't limited to just
;; things which are defined as function keys; any symbol in the event
;; queue gets used that way (like, for example, those invented as menu
;; entries) .  You define them in the same way as function keys.
;; There's a starter set at the end of this file, designed for use
;; with a "Gamepad"-style controller.

;; Buttons are sent as "-down" and "-up" events, but they also act as
;; modifiers to each other.  If a button has been used as a modifier
;; (i.e. another one was pressed while it was down), it sends a
;; "-release" event instead of "-up".  This way, you can use the same
;; buttons as modifiers and commands, according to whether or not they
;; have actually modified anything by the time they were released.

;; Modifier names are abbreviated versions of the button names
;; (uppercase letters, lowercase letters immediately following
;; uppercase letters, digits are all kept, the rest are dropped).  The
;; modifier names come before the button name, in an attempt to align
;; with the Emacs practice of putting "C-" and "M-C-" etc at the start
;; of key names.

;; For example, you can get event sequences like these:

;;       Trigger-down
;;       Trigger-up

;;       Trigger-down
;;       Tr-TopBtn-down
;;       Tr-TopBtn-up
;;       Trigger-release

;; Note that if you're using "-up" codes for chording, it makes a
;; difference which button you take your finger off last.  This makes
;; for a potentially extremely subtle chording keyboard!

;; Axes are sent as "-next" and "-previous" events, and the rate at
;; which they are sent depends on how far the joystick has been pushed
;; in that direction.  Modifiers also apply to them.

;; There are a few other s-exps that the joystick communication
;; process sends, but these are mostly for information and some are
;; used "internally" by this package.  For example, as it initializes,
;; the joystick communication process reports back what buttons and
;; axes it has; the Lisp code collects those up for use as completion
;; tables.

;; To see for yourself what it sends, run "joylisp" directly from a
;; shell, and watch its output as you press things.  Type "quit" at it
;; to make it go away.

;; I've observed that occasionally my joystick "disappears" from the
;; system, and comes back as "/dev/js1" instead of "/dev/js0".
;; There's some code at the top of `joystick-start' to try to handle
;; things like this.

;; You can also send commands to control the joystick communication
;; process, using `joystick-command'.  This lets you configure the
;; sensitivity of each channel, and various things like that.

;; See the comment at the top of joylisp.c for what the commands are.

;; Some of the Lisp commands in this package (`joystick-set-rate',
;; etc) are packaged versions of `joystick-command'.

;; Things which it might be good to do to this:

;; (1) Complete the multiple joystick support

;; (2) Allow the connection to the joystick communication process to
;;     work over the network, so people can put their joystick on their
;;     X-server rather than having to have it locally on the host on which
;;     their Emacs is running

;;; History:

;; John Sturdy was already interested in non-keyboard Emacs input,
;; particularly for use with the high-level editing package Versor
;; <http://emacs-versor.sourceforge.net/>.

;; Shae Erisson asked about using a joystick with Emacs, on EmacsWiki.

;; John Sturdy eventually got a joystick (gamepad) and wrote this.

;; The general idea (of receiving s-exps from the process, and sending
;; simple line commands to it) came from Barry Jaspan's vr.el, which
;; listens to a glue program using Dragon's voice input API, and the
;; code started off from fragments of that.  The C code grew from a
;; fragment of Vojtech Pavlik's jstest.c.

;; Initially written 2007-08-29.

;;;; Completion-related actions useful in the minibuffer

;; Text entry using the joystick hat switch, like on some GPS units.
;;
;; (I haven't yet done a patent search for this; I'm pretty sure the
;; idea is ancient and general, and also I've made this much nicer for
;; when choosing from a known set of choices.)
;;
;; Laborious, but for a couple of letters could be worth doing if you
;; don't want to move your hands from joystick to keyboard; and might
;; be useful for people with limited dexterity (possibly with a
;; specially-built hat switch) .
;;
;; There are two forms of entry supported:
;;
;; (1) Non-completing, in which "up" and "down" just bump the
;;     character at point to the next possible character, and "right"
;;     moves you to the next character position (or inserts a letter
;;     half-way through the alphabet if it was blank)
;; (2) Completing, in which "up" and "down" move you to the next
;;     letter that has a valid completion at that point, and "right"
;;     moves you to the next point at which completions differ.
;;
;; I've had another idea for text entry using a gamepad: since there
;; are two mini-joysticks, each with eight easily-recognized octants,
;; it should be possible to enter 8*8 = 64 possible characters using
;; them.  I may well write this soon.

In the following table, the characters in between [ ] in the
first column indicate the shoulder buttons \(the buttons on the
surface of the controller facing away from you), using ASCII
characters made of lines.  The lower row represents the ones
nearer you as seen if you were to flatten the controller like a
tigerskin rug \(i.e. actually the upper row of buttons on the
controller).  Thus, a \"=\" means both buttons on one side, \"_\"
means just the button nearer you on that side, and \"-\" means
just the button further from you.

\(v) indicates that a facility is part of emacs-versor \(see
