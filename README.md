# Versor: Emacs Versatile Cursors

This repo is a mirror of
https://sourceforge.net/projects/emacs-versor/, a fascinating Emacs
project that allows you to move the cursor (point in Emacs
terminology) by semantic units.

The Sourceforge page has not been updated since 2013, and the code is
stored in CVS. I exported the code [following their rsync
instructions](http://emacs-versor.cvs.sourceforge.net/) and converted
using cvs2git.

All copyright belongs to the original author. The code is licensed
under the GPL, see the file headers and LICENSE.txt.
